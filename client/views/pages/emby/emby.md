#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What is it?

Emby is a service you run on your own devices (my personal server) that acts as a "personal home-run Netflix". It allows you to stream movies, TV, and music from my server to your device.

Available content:

- Over **650 movies**
- Over **70 TV shows** with nearly **6,000 episodes**

If I am missing a movie or show, just ask. Most movies can be added within **1-2 hours**. TV shows may take a bit longer depending on the number of episodes. *Older movies or shows may not be available*.

#### <i class="fas fa-balance-scale-right"></i> But is it legal?

Short answer: **yes**.

In Canada, the laws restrict you from charging others for access to copyrighted media. Downloading media **is legal** in Canada. **Privately** sharing for free is also legal. If I were to try and make money from this, then there would be problems. I run my software with added protections as well.

#### <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Downloads

Similar to Netflix/Disney+, you can download media to your device for offline viewing. It is recommended to download at a lower quality to save space.

#### <i class="fas fa-share"></i> Sharing

Please **do not** share your login with anyone else!

#### <i class="fas fa-signal-alt"></i> Data usage

Movies and TV shows can easily be "transcoded" to a lower quality to be able to stream them faster without buffering. This is enabled by default when outside my WiFi network.
